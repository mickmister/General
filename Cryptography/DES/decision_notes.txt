converting to int whenever doing xors or shifts
use bitwise calculations to perform these operations, then convert back into binary string
have ints in sbox calculations, convert into binary strings

OR

keep everything as binary strings
perform permutations, xors and shifts using string operations
have binary strings in sbox arrays



SBox handling:

8 2-d string/int arrays
would need 8 separate functions

OR

1 3-d array string/int array
call each sbox using index 0-7


if int arrays are used, need to convert to binary string length 4 every time

since the input is a binary string, and the output is a binary string, then all calculations could be done keeping all data in binary strings
